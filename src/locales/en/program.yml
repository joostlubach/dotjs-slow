    An infinite loop is a situation where your program keeps running
    indefinitely.

    This often happens when using a `for` or `while` loop. If you're using a loop, make sure that your
    loop has a *stopping* condition, meaning that the `condition` in `while (condition) {...}` or
    `for (...; condition; ...) {...}` should at some point become `false`.

    Another possibility is that you call some function which calls itself.
